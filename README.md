# XYZ Reader

Transformed the user experience of a news reading app using Material Design principles. This includes consistent and meaningful use of Material Design UI components, fonts, color, motion and surfaces.

##Implementations

- App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
- App theme extends from AppCompat.
- App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.

- App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
